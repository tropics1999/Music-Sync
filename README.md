# Music-Sync
Sync Youtube to Tidal using a small python script.

## Instructions
1. Install and follow the setup instructions for python-dotenv (https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv), ytmusicapi (https://github.com/sigma67/ytmusicapi) and python-tidalapi (https://github.com/tamland/python-tidal)
2. Run every cell in the notebook. Note: if you are running once then do not worry about adding a .env file - however if running more than once it is 100% worth it!
3. On the second line of the second section change the number (x) in yt.get_library_songs(x) to something larger than your library
4. Run every cell of the notebook and all should work. Note: the second session will take a long time to run for arge libraries.
5. Done!

I may or may not come back to this project and make it more user friendly / expand its functionality outside of just ripping the Youtube Library to Tidal Favourites. But for now, enjoy!
